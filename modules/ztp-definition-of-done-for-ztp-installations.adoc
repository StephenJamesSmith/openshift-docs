= Indication of done for ZTP installations

Zero touch provisioning (ZTP) simplifies the process of checking for a completed
ZTP installation by adding a {rh-rhacm-first} static validator inform policy.
This policy captures the existing criteria for a completed installation and validates that it moves
to a compliant state only when ZTP provisioning of the spoke cluster is complete.

The validator inform policy ensures the configuration of the distributed unit (DU) cluster is fully applied and
Operators have completed their initialization. The policy validates the following:

* The target `MachineConfigPool` contains the expected entries and has finished
updating. All nodes are available and not degraded.
* The SRIOV Operator has completed initialization as indicated by at least one
`SriovNetworkNodeState` with `syncStatus: Succeeded`.
* The PTP Operator daemon set exists.

The policy captures the existing criteria for a completed installation and validates that it moves
to a compliant state only when ZTP provisioning of the spoke cluster is complete.

ZTP uses the `PolicyGenTemplate` custom resource (CR) to define {rh-rhacm} policies that the
`PolicyGenerator` calls to create the policies.
